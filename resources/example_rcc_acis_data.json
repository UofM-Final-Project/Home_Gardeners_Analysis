climate observations from approximately 30 different data sources. Version 3 was released in September 2012 with the addition of data from two additional station networks. Changes to the processing system associated with the version 3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on most weekdays. Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, snowfall and snow depth. Over 25,000 stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCN-Daily is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCN-Daily station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.","dataTypes":[{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"Maximum soil temperature with unknown cover

Surface Dataset (ISD) is composed of worldwide surface weather observations from over 35,000 stations, though the best spatial coverage is evident in North America, Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia. Parameters included are: air quality, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature/dew point, atmospheric winds, clouds, precipitation, ocean waves, tides and more. ISD refers to the data contained within the digital database as well as the format in which the hourly, synoptic (3-hourly), and daily weather observations are stored. The format conforms to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). ISD provides hourly data that can be used in a wide range of climatological applications. For some stations, data may go as far back as 1901, though most data show a substantial increase in volume in the 1940s and again in the early 1970s. Currently, there are over 14,000 \"active\" stations updated daily in the database.\n\nFor user convenience, a subset of just the hourly data is available to users for download. It is referred to as Integrated Surface Global Hourly data, see associated download links for access to this subset.","dataTypes":[{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"Hourly Temperature Section (Crn)

meteorological elements from 1763 to present with updates applied weekly. The major parameters are: monthly mean maximum, mean minimum and mean temperatures; monthly total precipitation and snowfall; departure from normal of the mean temperature and total precipitation; monthly heating and cooling degree days; number of days that temperatures and precipitation are above or below certain thresholds; extreme daily temperature and precipitation amounts; number of days with fog; and number of days with thunderstorms. The primary input data source is the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset. The Global Summaries datasets also include a yearly resolution of meteorological elements in the GSOY (for Yearly) dataset. See associated resources for more information. These datasets are not to be confused with \"GHCN-Monthly\", \"Annual Summaries\" or \"NCDC Summary of the Month\". There are unique elements that are produced globally within the GSOM and GSOY data files. There are also bias corrected temperature data in GHCN-Monthly, which are not available in GSOM and GSOY. The GSOM and GSOY datasets replace the legacy U.S. COOP Summaries (DSI-3220), and have been expanded to include non-U.S. (global) stations. U.S. COOP Summaries (DSI-3220) only includes National Weather Service (NWS) COOP Published, or \"Published in CD\", sites.","dataTypes":[{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"Lowest minimum soil temperature -

The major parameters are: – average annual temperature, average annual minimum and maximum temperatures; total annual precipitation and snowfall; departure from normal of the mean temperature and total precipitation; heating and cooling degree days; number of days that temperatures and precipitation are above or below certain thresholds; extreme annual minimum and maximum temperatures; number of days with fog; and number of days with thunderstorms. The primary input data source is the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily (GHCN-Daily) dataset. The Global Summaries datasets also include a monthly resolution of meteorological elements in the GSOM (for Monthly) dataset. See associated resources for more information. These datasets are not to be confused with \"GHCN-Monthly\", \"Annual Summaries\" or \"NCDC Summary of the Month\". There are unique elements that are produced globally within the GSOM and GSOY data files. There are also bias corrected temperature data in GHCN-Monthly, which are not available in GSOM and GSOY. The GSOM and GSOY datasets replace the legacy U.S. COOP Summaries (DSI-3220), and have been expanded to include non-U.S. (global) stations. U.S. COOP Summaries (DSI-3220) only includes National Weather Service (NWS) COOP Published, or \"Published in CD\", sites.","dataTypes":[{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"Lowest minimum soil temperature -

This new version of COOP HPD with faster automations due updated stations will result in faster access for the public. The data are from 1940 to present, depending upon when each station was installed. These stations, nearly all of which were part of HPD version 1, also known as DSI-3240, were gradually upgraded from paper punch tape data recording systems to a more modern electronic data logger system from 2004-2013.\n\nThe 15-min gauge depth time series are processed at NCEI via automated quality control and filtering algorithms to identify and remove spurious observations from noise and malfunctioning equipment, and also those due to natural phenomena such as evaporation and the necessary occasional emptying of the gauge. Hourly precipitation totals are then computed from the 15-min data and are quality controlled by a suite of automated algorithms that combine checks on the daily and hourly time scale. Data and metadata are ingested on a daily basis and combined in a single integrated dataset. \n\nAs with the legacy punch paper instrumentation, the electronic loggers record rain gauge depth every 15 minutes. Monthly site visits to each station are still performed, but instead of collecting punched paper (that would subsequently need conversion to a digital record via a MITRON reader), data are downloaded from the station's datalogger to a memory stick and centrally collected at the local Weather Forecast Office (WFO) for all stations in the WFO area. The WFO subsequently combines all data into a single tar file and transfers the data to NCEI via ftp upload nominally each month. \n\nThis updated HPD includes the historical data from the punch paper era and the recent digital era in order to provide the full period of record for each location. These data are formatted consistent with practices for NCEI Global In-situ datasets.","dataTypes":[{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR19S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR19S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR10QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR12Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR07QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR01MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR03QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR20MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR15S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR15S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR09MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR06Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR21Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR11S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR11S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR05MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR08S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR08S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR22QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR17Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR19QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR13MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR15QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR04S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR04S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR23S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR23S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR17MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR03Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR00S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR00S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR08Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR11QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"DlySumS2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"DlySumS1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR14Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR08QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR02MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR04QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR21MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR23QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR16S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR16S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR12S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR12S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR06MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR00Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR09S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR09S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR00QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR11Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR20S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR22Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR20S1"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR14MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR16QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR19Val"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR10MF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR12QF"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR05S2"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"","id":"HR05Val"},{"dateRange":{"star

The CDR spans from 1979 to the present with daily, global coverage generated from between two and ten NOAA and MetOp satellite passes per day. The source AVHRR data points, with a sensor resolution of 1.09 km near nadir, have been fitted to a 0.1 x 0.1 degree equal-angle grid in ascending and descending files. The calibrated reflectance channels in the visible spectrum (0.63, 0.86, and 1.6 microns) portion of the record were delivered as a CDR in Version 5.2 in 2010. This updated Version 5.3 extends the product to include brightness temperatures from the 3.75, 11 and 12 micron channels, as well as a suite of cloud products (the PATMOS-x Cloud Properties CDR). Version 5.3 also extends the period of record through the present and applies the newest calibration coefficients. In total, there are seven (7) AVHRR channel variables. Not counting the coordinate variables, there are 48 data and ancillary data variables in the netCDF data file to facilitate proper data usage. The file format was converted from HDF to netCDF-4 with metadata following the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions and Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD). The dataset is accompanied by algorithm documentation, data flow diagram and source code for the NOAA CDR Program.","dataTypes":[{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"temp_11_0um_nom","id":"temp_11_0um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cloud_probability","id":"cloud_probability"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_emiss_acha","id":"cld_emiss_acha"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cloud_mask","id":"cloud_mask"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cloud_fraction_uncertainty","id":"cloud_fraction_uncertainty"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_1_60um_nom_counts","id":"refl_1_60um_nom_counts"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_reff_dcomp","id":"cld_reff_dcomp"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_opd_dcomp_unc","id":"cld_opd_dcomp_unc"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"temp_12_0um_nom","id":"temp_12_0um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"sensor_zenith_angle","id":"sensor_zenith_angle"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_0_86um_nom_counts","id":"refl_0_86um_nom_counts"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"dcomp_quality","id":"dcomp_quality"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_0_86um_nom","id":"refl_0_86um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"solar_zenith_angle","id":"solar_zenith_angle"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cloud_transmission_0_65um_nom","id":"cloud_transmission_0_65um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cloud_fraction","id":"cloud_fraction"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"solar_azimuth_angle","id":"solar_azimuth_angle"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_temp_acha","id":"cld_temp_acha"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_1_60um_nom","id":"refl_1_60um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"dcomp_info","id":"dcomp_info"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"bad_pixel_mask","id":"bad_pixel_mask"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"scan_line_time","id":"scan_line_time"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"temp_11_0um_nom_clear_sky","id":"temp_11_0um_nom_clear_sky"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_reff_dcomp_unc","id":"cld_reff_dcomp_unc"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_height_uncer_acha","id":"cld_height_uncer_acha"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"temp_3_75um_nom","id":"temp_3_75um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_press_acha","id":"cld_press_acha"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_opd_dcomp","id":"cld_opd_dcomp"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"acha_info","id":"acha_info"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_0_65um_nom_counts","id":"refl_0_65um_nom_counts"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"temp_11_0um_nom_stddev_3x3","id":"temp_11_0um_nom_stddev_3x3"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"snow_class","id":"snow_class"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cloud_type","id":"cloud_type"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_0_65um_nom_stddev_3x3","id":"refl_0_65um_nom_stddev_3x3"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"scan_element_number","id":"scan_element_number"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_3_75um_nom","id":"refl_3_75um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"glint_mask","id":"glint_mask"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_reff_acha","id":"cld_reff_acha"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"relative_azimuth_angle","id":"relative_azimuth_angle"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_opd_acha","id":"cld_opd_acha"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"scan_line_number","id":"scan_line_number"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"land_class","id":"land_class"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cloud_water_path","id":"cloud_water_path"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"cld_height_acha","id":"cld_height_acha"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"refl_0_65um_nom","id":"refl_0_65um_nom"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"end":null},"searchWeight":1,"name":"surface_type","id":"surface_type"},{"dateRange":{"start":null,"e
