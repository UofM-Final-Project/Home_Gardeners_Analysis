# Machine Learning Notes

- Here are 2 .ipynb machine learning files that will be used in predicting frost.
- These are both used as a provisional machine learning models and will be refactored as project progresses.
- Both programs read in example csv file from a resources folder to test if they are working, but can change to read in from another source.
- Used logistic regression for categorical, predicts what makes a day have frost and chance there will be a day of frost after a specific day.
- Future improvements will use linear regression to track and try to predict the last day of frost for the spring.

### Each Program Specifics

- LogisReg_chance_day_is_frost.ipynb -> Outcome which day will have frost, 1 means there was frost 0 means no frost

- LogisReg_chance_frost_after_day.ipynb -> Outcome there is a day of frost after specific day 3/5(March 5th) per year, 1 means there was frost 0 means no frost
